# Hi there!

![portrait-image](/assets/images/k-private-square.jpg)

My name is Kåre Overgård, and I am a freelance IT consultant specializing in infrastructure, identity management & automation for Microsoft platforms.

I started working with these technologies more than 30 years ago, with Windows 3.11 and NT. My journey has taken me through the introduction of Active Directory and Entra ID (FKA Azure AD), and Microsoft 365.

Along the way, I have been supporting these environments, helping with all sorts of upgrades and migrations to and from cloud platforms for a multitude of customers of different sizes.

Over the years, I have encountered a lot of different challenges and issues. So, I started this blog to start sharing some insights, tips, tricks, scripts or just crazy stories from my work.

If some of my ramblings or tools can help just a single person out there, I will consider it a success.

See you around!
